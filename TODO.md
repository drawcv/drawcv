### Todo
 - [ ] Get this working with shrinkray
 - [ ] Get rid of extra footer space
 - [ ] Get actual saving/loading working
 - [ ] Add complementary tool or workflow for easily taking draw.io files and
       generating SVG or Images from the command line. All to make it easier to
	   work with Github pages or doc generation like JSDocs.
